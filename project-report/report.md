## Abstract

As internet developed, online shopping has become part of our daily life. Black Friday, a traditional deal day, has also transformed as a big day for online shopping. The internet retailers, such Amazon, also developed their specific strategy for the combat in online shopping, Amazon Prime Day. In the e-commerce area, the volume of the sales and the product data increased rapidly. It is necessary to develop a cost-effective way to deal with the big data. The technique of relational data management has developed a lot in the last decades. In today's business analysis scenario, the relational technologies seem can not hold the large data since they are designed to deal with data which is much smaller in size. The developed internet techniques allow us collect and store the trading data, which could be the most valuable materials for researching customer behaviors.

## Introduction

### Commercial Data   

In order to extract the knowledge behind the commercial data generated by hundreds of thousands of consumers for the use of leading managers to make the decision, it is necessary to conduct a deep analysis to the commercial data, instead of generating simple reports. The deep analysis could hardly be done by SQL since the process relies on complex models. Without those models, it is impossible to get a profound understand of the commercial data. People will not only need to find out what is happening now, but also need to use data to make some predictions in order to make preparations for the future events. For example, if the manager is able to predict the loss of the customer in the future, they can use discount to attract the users again.   

In the context of big commercial data, the traditional OLAP operations are not enough anymore to meet the requirements, we also need path analysis, time series analysis, graph analysis, what-if analysis and some complex statistical models. Time series analysis, a useful method in the commercial data analysis since we have got lots of the trading historical data. The managers want to get some patterns in the data in order to fine some chances to improve the revenue. By the trend analysis, they can even predict some chances in advance. In the financial area, analysts are able to develop some software to conduct the time series analysis of the trading data, and find some profitable trading patterns. After further verification, they can use those profitable trading patterns to conduct the real trade and make profits.   

### Behavioral Data

Behavioral big data (BBD) refers to very large and rich multidimensional data sets on human and social behaviors, actions, and interactions, which have become available to companies, governments, and researchers. A growing number of researchers in social science and management fields acquire and analyze BBD for the purpose of extracting knowledge and scientific discoveries [1]. Besides, the online retailers also want to figure out the profound meanings behind the consumer's actions. So the behavioral big data comes across with research area and industry area, which results in different research methods. We use the methods in research area to analysis the dataset with specific models designed to the dataset from Kaggle.   

### Necessity of Big Data

Why we use big data method to conduct the analytics? The answer lies on the character of the real dataset generated in the real trading system. The system records the deal with some specific fields, which could be some information of price, time, discount, product information, product status, etc. The user behavior could also be recorded such as the action of adding to list, the time between order to payment, etc. If a user has the habit of adding many products to the list but only buy a few of them, you may observe the data and draw the conclusion that the user is rational and could hardly be affected by the advertisement. But if you have huge amount of data, maybe it is real time data, the only way to picture those consumers is establishing models and define the features, then use the big data methods to research them. 




## Dataset and Tools

### Commercial Data   

The basic concept of commercial data is very easy to understand. And the method of analyzing sales data provides a view to have a deep understanding of the sales data, which enables the managers to make a specific plan to conduct some strategies. In the process of analysis of the commercial data, they often analyze the historical price, and the design of product line to mine the relationships behind different departments, which could be a still base for a better sale strategy. There are some specific requirements of the commercial data, such as it must be objective and reliable, or it may mislead the decisions of the managers.   

### Dataset Description

The dataset we use here is from a retail store, it contains the information of transactions. To get a profound understand of customer behavior in different things. The first step is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the dataset to get an overview. The second step is to make a deeper study with different variables such as gender, age, city. If the owner wants to find the potential links between different product categorizes or specific links between group of people and products, they can do a cross analysis with different variables. The dataset is an ideal simple for classification and also clustering since all the needed information of the users is provided.   

Data columns (total 12 columns): User_ID: 537577 non-null int64, Product_ID: 537577 non-null object, Gender: 537577 non-null object, Age: 537577 non-null object, Occupation: 537577 non-null int64, City_Category: 537577 non-null object, Stay_In_Current_City_Years: 537577 non-null object, Marital_Status: 537577 non-null int64, Product_Category_1: 537577 non-null int64, Product_Category_2: 370591 non-null float64, Product_Category_3: 164278 non-null float64, Purchase: 537577 non-null int64   


## Implementation   
### Data Cleaning   

Data cleaning is a necessary step for the whole process of data cleaning. The result of the data cleaning will have significant impact on the efficiency of the model and the conclusions. In the practice, data cleaning often takes some time. There is also a domain about how to clean the dataset effectively.

### Data Exploration and Processing   

### Data Analysis and Data Visualization   



## Benchmark

## Conclusion

The conclusion drawn by the previous analytics, which could be the picture of owned consumers, the predict of the consumerâ€™s preferences.
